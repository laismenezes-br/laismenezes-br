## Lais Menezes âœŒ
I'm a Mechatronics Engineering student at IFCE and a Data Engineer Jr. Here's a brief overview of my skills and interests:

***About Me***

Data Engineering: Nowdays, I'm working as an Data Engineer Jr., so continuously developing my skills and knowledge as a professional in this area.

Python: Proficient in Python, I use it as my primary programming language for data engineering tasks and automation.

Airflow Orchestration: I have hands-on experience with Apache Airflow. I can design, schedule, and monitor data pipelines efficiently.

DBT (Data Build Tool): I'm familiar with DBT and its capabilities in transforming data into structured, analytics-ready formats. I can create and manage DBT models to streamline data transformation processes, also create macros and tests that are resourses from this tool.

Databricks: I'm working with Databricks, a cloud-based platform for big data analytics. I'm comfortable using Databricks notebooks for data exploration and analysis.

Linux: Basics knowledgment in Linux operating systems as Ubuntu. I can navigate the command line and perform basic system administration tasks.
